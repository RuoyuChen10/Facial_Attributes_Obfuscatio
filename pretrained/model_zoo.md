# Pre-trained Model

> Note: Due to the recent repair of our server, we only have the pre-training model on the [VGGFace2](https://github.com/ox-vgg/vgg_face2) dataset, and the pre-training model on the [Celeb-A](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset cannot be provided for the time being. We will provide it after the server is repaired.

## VGGFace Net

First download the pre-trained model, the model is convert from coffee version from official file, don't worry it doesn't work.
