> Note: We received a lot of requests from researchers about the code, so we decided to open source some of the collated code.

## üì∞ News & Update

- **[2024.06.05]** We have released the generator and the associated model parameter weights.
- **[2023.06.02]** We have released the verification evaluation metric and some results, please refer to the folder: [Test-Verification](./Test-Verification).
- **[2023.01.14]** We have released some preliminary code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Preparation

Please refer to [model_zoo.md](./pretrained/model_zoo.md) to download the pre-trained model to the folder [pretrained](./pretrained/).

Please align all your face images before. If you want to use vggface net, try `mode=vggface`, if you want to use arcface net, try `mode=arcface`. See [tutorial_facealignment.ipynb](tutorial_facealignment.ipynb).

Please refer to the manual of StarGAN v2 for installation environment

## üóùÔ∏è Stage 1, Identity-aware region discovery

run command:

```
sh stage1.sh
```

than, you can view the results in the saved fold (default is [results](results)). The facial attribute importance sort is writen in a json file like:

```json

    "0001_01-0.jpg":{

## üóùÔ∏è Stage 2, Identity-aware face obfuscation

After obtaining the most important attribute region, modify according to this region.

The code for the generator is in the [Generator](./Generator) folder.

<!-- In this part, you can directly use the official stargan v2, and combine the results obtained in the first stage for training and testing.
